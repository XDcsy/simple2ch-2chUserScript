### Functions
1. Adds line feeds at the end of the thread titles on the board page:<br>
![demoPic01](/demoPic01.jpg)<br>
(Note that 2ch has updated its style so on most boards this funciton is now not necessary. But there are still few boards using the old style.)
2. Adds line feeds on the "all threads" page.
3. Removes the comfirmation step when jumping to external urls form 2ch.<br>
