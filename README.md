### Install
There are 2 ways to use it.<br>
Either to install it as an extension or run it as a user script.<br>
When install it as an extension, download the `/extension` folder and load it under the developer mode of Chrome.<br>
A more convenient way is to run it as a user script. You'll need an userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en). After installing it, add the script in the `/user_script` folder to the manager and turn it on.
